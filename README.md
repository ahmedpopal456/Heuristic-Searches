# Heuristic-Searches
Search Algorithms

Personal Implementation of the Best-First, Breadth-First, A* and Depth-First Searches 

with different heuristics. The goal it to look at the efficiency of these goal-based problem solutions

based on the 8-Puzzle Problem. Input is a text file of the following format:  1 2 3 endl; 4 B 6 endl; 5 8 7
                                                                              
,while the output is the time each solution takes to run with different heuristics + a text file with 
 
all the moves the solution went through to get to the final solution 


* Note that all of the searches implement heuristics, as they should not
